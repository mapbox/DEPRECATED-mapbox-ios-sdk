CONTRIBUTING
------------

If you have a usage question, please email support-at-mapbox.com. 

If you want to contribute code: 

1. If it's generally useful to mapping libraries, consider contributing to the upstream project [Alpstein/route-me](http://github.com/alpstein/route-me), from which this project is derived. We regularly contribute the generally useful parts of our SDK to this project. 

1. If it's Mapbox-specific, fork and submit a pull request **against the `develop` branch** so that we can review, discuss, and possibly integrate your code.
